Hi, I’m @tmgall. I’m currently a Math + CS major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

I’m interested in computer science, math, and statistics. Their intersection is machine learning, which you can see is the basis of a lot of my projects! For some of my machine learning projects, check out my IrisNNClassification and Linear Regression Grade Predictor repositories. To find at some of my math research, take a look at CompetitionOnTorus. Last, for some fun, peek at my WikipediaGame repo.
